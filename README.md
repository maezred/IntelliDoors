IntelliDoors
============

> Plugin for Bukkit/Spigot (a mod for Minecraft).

## Overview

IntelliDoors provides additional functionality for doors, including:

  - When a player opens a door (i.e. no redstone), it can automatically close after a delay.
  - When a door has a sibling, that sibling can mirror the other.
  - When redstone power is lost doors can shut after a delay (not yet implemented).
  - Iron doors can be configured to open without redstone.

All features are fully configurable. Each type of door can be configured individually.
